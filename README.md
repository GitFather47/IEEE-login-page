# IEEE AIUB Student Branch Login Page

This is a login page project for the **IEEE AIUB Student Branch** built using **Next.js**, **Shadcn UI**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ieee-aiub-login.git
cd ieee-aiub-login
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically reload as you make changes.

## Features

- **Shadcn UI Components**: A modern, accessible, and customizable component library built on top of Tailwind CSS.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid development with minimal custom CSS.
- **Lucide-react Icons**: Includes the eye and eye-off icons for password visibility toggle.
- **Password Toggle**: Functionality to show or hide the password input field.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Documentation

### Project Structure

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application files, including the login page.
  - `page.tsx`: The primary page for the login form.

### How It Works
